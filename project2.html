        <p>
          This is a group project that centers around creating an application that can mark down and block suspected scsam/spam calls.
          So far, we have recently completed gathering user research and will be moving into prototyping an application soon.     
          Aside from doing parts of the project, I have also been keeping schedule and organizing the information that coes from research,

        <p>
          This project is currently ongoing, but I've learned and experienced a lot from it already.
          This is the first group project that hasn't been completely online for me since 2020.
          Because of that, I have been able to get a feel for working directly with a group again.
          Through this experience I have done my best to ensure the team stays ahead of deadlines for deliverables.
          Organization has been a great boon to this project, it lessens confusion while also increasing productivity.
          The three major skills that I have practiced and improved with this project so far are communication, organization, and time management.
