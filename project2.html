        <p>
          This is a group project that centers around creating an application that can mark down and block suspected scsam/spam calls.

        <h2 id="project-skills">Skills Learned</h2>
        <p>
          This project is currently ongoing, but I've learned and experienced a lot from it already.
          This is the first group project that hasn't been completely online for me since 2020.
